# Slug Uniqueness Removal

## Overview

This document describes the changes made to remove slug uniqueness constraints from the eceee_v4 backend, allowing multiple pages and content objects to have the same slug.

## Changes Made

### 1. Model Changes

#### WebPage Model (`backend/webpages/models.py`)
- **Before**: `slug = models.SlugField(max_length=255, unique=True)`
- **After**: `slug = models.SlugField(max_length=255)`
- **Note**: The `unique_together = ["parent", "slug"]` constraint remains to prevent URL conflicts within the same parent page hierarchy

#### BaseContentModel (`backend/content/models.py`)
- **Before**: `slug = models.SlugField(max_length=255, unique=True)`
- **After**: `slug = models.SlugField(max_length=255)`
- **Affects**: News, Event, LibraryItem, Member models

#### Category Model (`backend/content/models.py`)
- **Before**: `slug = models.SlugField(max_length=100, unique=True)`
- **After**: `slug = models.SlugField(max_length=100)`

#### Tag Model (`backend/content/models.py`)
- **Before**: `slug = models.SlugField(max_length=50, unique=True)`
- **After**: `slug = models.SlugField(max_length=50)`

### 2. Database Migrations

Two migrations were created and applied:

#### `content/migrations/0002_remove_slug_uniqueness.py`
- Removes unique constraint from Category, Event, LibraryItem, Member, News, and Tag slug fields

#### `webpages/migrations/0011_remove_slug_uniqueness.py`
- Removes unique constraint from WebPage slug field
- Also includes code_layout field changes

### 3. Validation Logic

No custom validation logic was found that enforced slug uniqueness, so no additional changes were required in:
- Serializers (`backend/webpages/serializers.py`)
- Model validation methods
- API endpoints

## Impact

### What's Now Allowed

1. **Root pages with same slug**: Multiple root pages can have the same slug
2. **Child pages with same slug**: Pages under different parents can have the same slug
3. **Content objects with same slug**: News articles, events, library items, and members can have the same slug
4. **Categories and tags with same slug**: Multiple categories and tags can have the same slug

### What's Still Constrained

1. **Sibling pages**: Pages with the same parent cannot have the same slug (due to `unique_together = ["parent", "slug"]`)
2. **Name fields**: Category and Tag name fields remain unique

## Testing

### Manual Tests Performed

1. **WebPage model test**: Successfully created pages with same slug under different parents
2. **Root page test**: Successfully created root pages with same slug
3. **Content model test**: Successfully created News, Category, and Tag objects with same slug
4. **Existing test suite**: All 19 existing tests pass

### Test Commands

```bash
# Run Django system check
docker-compose exec backend python manage.py check

# Run existing test suite
docker-compose exec backend python manage.py test webpages.tests -v 2

# Manual verification (see test output above)
docker-compose exec backend python manage.py shell
```

## URL Routing Considerations

### Current URL Structure

The system uses hostname-aware routing with the following patterns:

1. **Root pages**: `/{hostname}/{slug}/`
2. **Child pages**: `/{hostname}/{parent-slug}/{child-slug}/`
3. **Content objects**: `/{content-type}/{slug}/`

### Potential Conflicts

With duplicate slugs now allowed, consider these scenarios:

1. **Root page conflicts**: Multiple root pages with same slug on different hostnames
2. **Content object conflicts**: Multiple content objects with same slug in same content type
3. **URL resolution**: The system may need additional logic to handle ambiguous URLs

### Recommendations

1. **Frontend validation**: Consider adding client-side validation to warn users about potential URL conflicts
2. **URL generation**: Implement logic to generate unique URLs when conflicts occur
3. **SEO considerations**: Ensure proper canonical URLs and redirects for duplicate slugs
4. **Monitoring**: Add logging to track when duplicate slugs are created

## Rollback Plan

If needed, the changes can be rolled back by:

1. **Reverting model changes**: Add `unique=True` back to slug fields
2. **Creating new migration**: `python manage.py makemigrations --name restore_slug_uniqueness`
3. **Applying migration**: `python manage.py migrate`
4. **Data cleanup**: Manually resolve any duplicate slugs that were created

## Conclusion

The slug uniqueness constraints have been successfully removed from all models. The system now allows duplicate slugs while maintaining the hierarchical constraint for sibling pages. All existing functionality remains intact, and the change provides more flexibility for content management.
