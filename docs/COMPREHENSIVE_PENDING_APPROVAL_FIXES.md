# Comprehensive Pending Media Approval Fixes

## Root Cause Analysis

The pending media approval system was failing due to multiple interconnected issues:

1. **Queryset Filtering Issue**: The ViewSet only returned files with `status="pending"`, but approval actions needed access to files regardless of status
2. **Exception Handling Issue**: Wrong exception type was being caught for missing files
3. **Duplicate Hash Handling**: Files with same hash were causing database constraint violations
4. **Already Processed Files**: No graceful handling for files that were already approved

## Comprehensive Fixes Implemented

### 1. Fixed Queryset Filtering for Actions

**Problem**: `get_queryset()` only returned pending files, but approval/rejection actions needed access to all files
**Solution**: Modified queryset to allow access to all statuses for approval/rejection actions

```python
def get_queryset(self):
    """Filter pending files by user and namespace access."""
    # For approval/rejection actions, allow access to all statuses
    if self.action in ['approve', 'reject']:
        queryset = PendingMediaFile.objects.all()
    else:
        # For list/retrieve actions, only show pending files
        queryset = PendingMediaFile.objects.filter(status="pending")
    # ... rest of filtering logic
```

### 2. Fixed Exception Handling

**Problem**: ViewSet's `get_object()` raises `Http404`, not `PendingMediaFile.DoesNotExist`
**Solution**: Updated exception handling to catch both exception types

```python
try:
    pending_file = self.get_object()
except (PendingMediaFile.DoesNotExist, Http404):
    return Response(
        {"error": "Pending file not found or already processed"},
        status=status.HTTP_404_NOT_FOUND,
    )
```

### 3. Added Already-Approved File Handling

**Problem**: Files that were already approved would cause errors when approval was attempted again
**Solution**: Added explicit handling for already-approved files

```python
# If file is already approved, return success with existing media file
if pending_file.status == "approved":
    # Find the corresponding media file
    existing_file = MediaFile.objects.filter(
        file_hash=pending_file.file_hash, namespace=pending_file.namespace
    ).first()
    
    if existing_file:
        # Handle collection assignment if requested
        # ... collection logic ...
        
        return Response({
            "status": "approved",
            "media_file": media_serializer.data,
            "message": "File was already approved",
        }, status=status.HTTP_200_OK)
```

### 4. Enhanced Duplicate Hash Detection

**Problem**: Files with same hash caused database constraint violations
**Solution**: Proactive duplicate detection before attempting to create MediaFile

```python
# Check if file with same hash already exists
existing_file = MediaFile.objects.filter(
    file_hash=pending_file.file_hash, namespace=pending_file.namespace
).first()

if existing_file:
    # File already exists, just mark as approved and optionally add to collection
    pending_file.status = "approved"
    pending_file.save()
    
    # Handle collection assignment if requested
    # ... collection logic ...
    
    return Response({
        "status": "approved", 
        "media_file": media_serializer.data,
        "message": "File already exists, added to library"
    }, status=status.HTTP_200_OK)
```

### 5. Added Collection Support to Approval Process

**Problem**: Frontend was sending collection data but backend wasn't handling it
**Solution**: Extended approval serializer and logic to support collections

```python
# In MediaFileApprovalSerializer
collection_id = serializers.UUIDField(required=False, allow_null=True)
collection_name = serializers.CharField(max_length=255, required=False, allow_blank=True)

# In approval logic
def _get_or_create_collection(self, collection_id, collection_name, namespace, user):
    """Get existing collection or create new one."""
    if collection_id:
        try:
            return MediaCollection.objects.get(id=collection_id, namespace=namespace)
        except MediaCollection.DoesNotExist:
            return None
    elif collection_name:
        collection, created = MediaCollection.objects.get_or_create(
            title=collection_name,
            namespace=namespace,
            defaults={
                "created_by": user,
                "last_modified_by": user,
                "access_level": "public",
            },
        )
        return collection
    return None
```

## Error Scenarios Now Handled

### ✅ **404 Errors - "No PendingMediaFile matches the given query"**
- **Before**: Files not found in queryset due to status filtering
- **After**: Approval actions can access files regardless of status
- **Result**: Clear error messages for truly missing files

### ✅ **Duplicate Hash Errors - "duplicate key value violates unique constraint"**
- **Before**: Attempted to create MediaFile for existing hash
- **After**: Proactive duplicate detection and graceful handling
- **Result**: Returns existing file and optionally adds to collection

### ✅ **Already Approved Files**
- **Before**: Would cause errors or unexpected behavior
- **After**: Graceful handling with success response
- **Result**: Idempotent approval process

### ✅ **Collection Assignment**
- **Before**: Collection data ignored during approval
- **After**: Full support for adding approved files to collections
- **Result**: Seamless workflow from approval to organization

## Benefits of the Comprehensive Fix

1. **Robust Error Handling**: All edge cases are handled gracefully
2. **Idempotent Operations**: Approving the same file multiple times is safe
3. **Collection Integration**: Approved files can be immediately organized
4. **User-Friendly Messages**: Clear feedback about what happened
5. **Data Integrity**: No duplicate files or constraint violations
6. **Fault Tolerance**: Collection failures don't prevent file approval

## Testing Results

The system now handles all previously failing scenarios:
- ✅ **Missing Files**: Clear 404 responses with helpful messages
- ✅ **Duplicate Files**: Graceful detection and existing file return
- ✅ **Already Processed**: Success responses for already-approved files
- ✅ **Collection Assignment**: Full support for organizing approved files
- ✅ **Batch Operations**: Other files continue processing if some fail

## User Experience Improvements

1. **No More Crashes**: All error conditions handled gracefully
2. **Clear Feedback**: Users understand what happened with each file
3. **Workflow Continuity**: Can approve files directly into collections
4. **Batch Processing**: Partial failures don't stop the entire operation
5. **Consistent Behavior**: Predictable responses regardless of file state

The pending media approval system is now robust, user-friendly, and handles all edge cases that were causing the original errors.
