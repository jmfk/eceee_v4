## Notes for QA Team

- This checklist should be customized based on specific project requirements
- Not all items may be applicable to every deployment
- Priority should be given to critical path functionality
- Automated testing should cover as many items as possible
- Manual testing should focus on user experience and edge cases
- Performance benchmarks should be established before testing begins
- All test results should be documented and tracked
