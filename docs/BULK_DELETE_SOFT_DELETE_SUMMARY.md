# Bulk Delete & Soft Delete Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented soft delete functionality with bulk operations for pages. This allows reversible deletion where pages are marked as deleted rather than being permanently removed from the database.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Soft Delete Fields** ✅
Added three new fields to the `WebPage` model:
- `is_deleted` (Boolean, indexed) - Marks if page is deleted
- `deleted_at` (DateTime) - When the page was deleted
- `deleted_by` (ForeignKey to User) - Who deleted the page

### 2. **Model Methods** ✅
Added three helper methods to `WebPage` model:

**`soft_delete(user, recursive=False)`**
- Marks page as deleted (soft delete)
- If `recursive=True`, also deletes all descendant pages
- Returns count of pages deleted
- Sets `is_deleted`, `deleted_at`, and `deleted_by`

**`restore(user, recursive=False)`**
- Restores a soft-deleted page
- If `recursive=True`, also restores all descendant pages
- Returns count of pages restored
- Clears `is_deleted`, `deleted_at`, and `deleted_by`

**`get_all_descendants(include_deleted=False)`**
- Gets all descendant pages recursively
- Can optionally include deleted pages
- Returns list of pages (not QuerySet)

### 3. **API Endpoints** ✅
Added three new endpoints to `WebPageViewSet`:

#### POST `/api/v1/pages/bulk-delete/`
Bulk soft delete multiple pages.

**Request**:
```json
{
    "page_ids": [1, 2, 3],
    "recursive": true  // optional, default false
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
    "message": "Successfully deleted 5 page(s)",
    "total_deleted": 5,
    "pages": [
        {
            "id": 1,
            "title": "News",
            "slug": "news",
            "deleted_count": 3
        }
    ],
    "recursive": true
}
```

#### POST `/api/v1/pages/bulk-restore/`
Bulk restore multiple soft-deleted pages.

**Request**:
```json
{
    "page_ids": [1, 2, 3],
    "recursive": true  // optional, default false
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
    "message": "Successfully restored 5 page(s)",
    "total_restored": 5,
    "pages": [
        {
            "id": 1,
            "title": "News",
            "slug": "news",
            "restored_count": 3
        }
    ],
    "recursive": true
}
```

#### GET `/api/v1/pages/deleted/`
List all soft-deleted pages.

**Response**: Standard paginated list of pages (with `is_deleted=true`)

### 4. **Query Filtering** ✅
Updated `WebPageViewSet.get_queryset()` to:
- **Exclude deleted pages by default** from all endpoints
- Show deleted pages only in `list_deleted` and `bulk_restore` endpoints
- Maintains existing permission and publication filtering

### 5. **Serializer Updates** ✅
Updated both serializers to include soft delete fields:
- `WebPageTreeSerializer` - includes `is_deleted`, `deleted_at`, `deleted_by`
- `WebPageSimpleSerializer` - includes same fields (read-only)

### 6. **Database Migration** ✅
Created migration: `0036_add_soft_delete_fields.py`
- Adds `is_deleted`, `deleted_at`, `deleted_by` fields
- Safe to run (no data loss)
- Backward compatible

## Usage Examples

### Delete Single Page (Non-Recursive)
```python
page = WebPage.objects.get(id=1)
count = page.soft_delete(user=request.user, recursive=False)
# Deletes only this page, count = 1
```

### Delete Page Tree (Recursive)
```python
news_page = WebPage.objects.get(slug="news")
count = news_page.soft_delete(user=request.user, recursive=True)
# Deletes news page and all its children/descendants
# count = total number of pages deleted
```

### Bulk Delete via API
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/pages/bulk-delete/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "page_ids": [1, 2, 3],
    "recursive": true
  }'
```

### Restore Page Tree
```python
page = WebPage.objects.get(id=1)
count = page.restore(user=request.user, recursive=True)
# Restores page and all its descendants
```

### List Deleted Pages
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/pages/deleted/
```

## Database Schema

### New Fields
```python
is_deleted = BooleanField(default=False, db_index=True)
deleted_at = DateTimeField(null=True, blank=True)
deleted_by = ForeignKey(User, null=True, blank=True)
```

### Indexes
- `is_deleted` is indexed for fast filtering
- Existing indexes remain unchanged

## Behavior & Rules

### Default Behavior
1. **All queries exclude deleted pages** by default
2. Deleted pages don't appear in:
   - List views
   - Tree views
   - Hierarchy views
   - Public views
3. Deleted pages only visible in:
   - `/api/v1/pages/deleted/` endpoint
   - When specifically querying with `is_deleted=True`

### Recursive Deletion
- When `recursive=True`:
  - Deletes the page
  - Recursively deletes all children
  - Recursively deletes all grandchildren (etc.)
  - Returns total count of deleted pages
- When `recursive=False`:
  - Only deletes the specified page
  - Children remain active (now orphaned if parent deleted)

### Recursive Restoration
- When `recursive=True`:
  - Restores the page
  - Recursively restores all descendants
  - Updates `last_modified_by` for all restored pages
- When `recursive=False`:
  - Only restores the specified page
  - Children remain deleted

### Bulk Operations
- Can delete/restore multiple pages in one request
- Each page can be deleted/restored with or without descendants
- Returns detailed results for each page
- Validates all page_ids before processing

## Frontend Integration (To Be Implemented)

The backend is ready. Frontend needs:

### 1. Multi-Select in Tree View
- Add checkboxes to tree nodes
- Track selected page IDs
- Show selection count

### 2. Bulk Delete Action
- "Delete Selected" button
- Confirmation dialog:
  - Show count of selected pages
  - Checkbox: "Also delete all child pages (recursive)"
  - Warning about recursive deletion
- Call `/api/v1/pages/bulk-delete/` endpoint
- Refresh tree view after deletion

### 3. View Deleted Pages
- "View Deleted Pages" filter/tab
- Shows deleted pages (greyed out/strikethrough)
- "Restore" action for each page

### 4. Bulk Restore Action
- Select deleted pages
- "Restore Selected" button
- Checkbox: "Also restore all child pages"
- Call `/api/v1/pages/bulk-restore/` endpoint

### Example Frontend Code

```javascript
// Multi-select state
const [selectedPageIds, setSelectedPageIds] = useState([]);

// Delete selected pages
async function deleteSelected(recursive = false) {
  const confirmed = window.confirm(
    `Delete ${selectedPageIds.length} page(s)?` +
    (recursive ? ' This will also delete all child pages.' : '')
  );
  
  if (!confirmed) return;
  
  const response = await fetch('/api/v1/pages/bulk-delete/', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      page_ids: selectedPageIds,
      recursive: recursive
    })
  });
  
  const result = await response.json();
  alert(result.message);
  // Refresh tree view
  refetch();
}

// Restore selected pages
async function restoreSelected(recursive = false) {
  const response = await fetch('/api/v1/pages/bulk-restore/', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      page_ids: selectedPageIds,
      recursive: recursive
    })
  });
  
  const result = await response.json();
  alert(result.message);
  // Refresh tree view
  refetch();
}
```

## Security Considerations

### Permissions
- All endpoints require authentication (`IsAuthenticated`)
- Only authenticated users can delete/restore pages
- Deletion is tracked (`deleted_by` field)

### Soft Delete Benefits
1. **Reversible**: Mistakes can be undone
2. **Audit Trail**: Know who deleted what and when
3. **Data Integrity**: No orphaned references
4. **Compliance**: Retain data for regulatory requirements

### Hard Delete
- Not implemented (intentionally)
- If needed in future, add separate `hard_delete()` method
- Should require superuser permission
- Should only be allowed on already soft-deleted pages

## Migration Path

### Running the Migration
```bash
docker-compose exec backend python manage.py migrate webpages
```

### Post-Migration
- All existing pages will have `is_deleted=False`
- `deleted_at` and `deleted_by` will be `NULL`
- No data changes - purely additive

### Rollback (if needed)
The migration adds fields with defaults, safe to rollback:
```bash
docker-compose exec backend python manage.py migrate webpages 0035
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing
```python
# Create test page
page = WebPage.objects.create(
    slug="test",
    created_by=user,
    last_modified_by=user
)

# Soft delete
page.soft_delete(user=user)
assert page.is_deleted == True
assert page.deleted_at is not None
assert page.deleted_by == user

# Verify not in default queryset
assert not WebPage.objects.filter(id=page.id).exists()

# But exists in all()
assert WebPage.objects.filter(id=page.id, is_deleted=True).exists()

# Restore
page.restore(user=user)
assert page.is_deleted == False
assert page.deleted_at is None
assert page.deleted_by is None

# Verify back in default queryset
assert WebPage.objects.filter(id=page.id).exists()
```

### API Testing
```bash
# Delete pages
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/pages/bulk-delete/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"page_ids": [1, 2], "recursive": true}'

# List deleted pages
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/pages/deleted/ \
  -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_TOKEN"

# Restore pages
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/pages/bulk-restore/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"page_ids": [1, 2], "recursive": true}'
```
