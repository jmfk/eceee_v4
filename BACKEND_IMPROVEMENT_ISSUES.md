## Issue 1: Remove wildcard imports in widget compatibility layer
**Priority:** Medium  
**Labels:** backend-improvement, code-quality

### Problem
Found wildcard imports in the widget compatibility layer files:
- `backend/webpages/widget_models.py:9`: `from core_widgets.widget_models import *`
- `backend/webpages/widgets.py:12`: `from core_widgets.widgets import *`

### Why This Matters
- Makes it difficult to track dependencies
- Can cause namespace pollution
- Violates PEP 8 guidelines
- Makes code harder to understand and debug

### Proposed Solution
Replace wildcard imports with explicit imports of only the needed components, or restructure the compatibility layer to avoid needing to import everything.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Remove all wildcard imports from widget compatibility files
- [ ] Replace with explicit imports where needed
- [ ] Ensure all existing functionality continues to work
- [ ] Update any documentation referencing these imports

## Issue 2: Fix Django settings configuration issues
**Priority:** High  
**Labels:** backend-improvement, configuration

### Problem
Several configuration issues in `backend/config/settings.py`:

1. **Incorrect config key on lines 180-182:**
   ```python
   CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS = config(
       "CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS", default="http://localhost:3000,http://127.0.0.1:3000"
   ).split(",")
   ```
   Should use "CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS" key, not "CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS"

2. **Legacy deprecated allauth settings (lines 242-245):**
   Comments say they're deprecated but are kept for reference - should be removed

3. **Commented-out code (lines 157-159):**
   STATICFILES_DIRS is commented out and should be cleaned up

### Proposed Solution
- Fix the CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS configuration key
- Remove deprecated allauth settings comments
- Clean up commented-out STATICFILES_DIRS code
- Ensure all configuration is consistent and up-to-date

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS uses correct config key
- [ ] Remove deprecated allauth settings comments
- [ ] Clean up commented-out code
- [ ] Test that all settings work correctly in development and production

## Issue 3: Refactor oversized WebPage model (1495 lines) - violates SRP
**Priority:** High  
**Labels:** backend-improvement, refactoring, architecture

### Problem
The WebPage model in `backend/webpages/models.py` is 1495 lines long and handles multiple responsibilities:
- Page hierarchy and inheritance
- Publishing workflow
- CSS injection and styling
- Object publishing links
- Hostname management and routing
- Version control
- Theme inheritance

This violates the Single Responsibility Principle and makes the code difficult to maintain, test, and understand.

### Proposed Solution
Break the WebPage model into focused, single-responsibility classes:

1. **WebPage** (core page data and basic operations)
2. **PageHierarchyManager** (parent-child relationships, inheritance)
3. **PagePublishingService** (publishing workflow, scheduling)
4. **PageStyleManager** (CSS, themes, styling)
5. **ObjectPublishingService** (linking to content objects)
6. **HostnameManager** (hostname routing for multi-site)

### Benefits
- Easier to test individual components
- Better separation of concerns
- More maintainable code
- Easier to extend functionality
- Follows SOLID principles

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create separate service classes for different responsibilities
- [ ] Maintain all existing functionality
- [ ] Update tests to work with new structure
- [ ] Ensure backward compatibility for existing API endpoints
- [ ] Document the new architecture

## Issue 4: Eliminate code duplication in content ViewSets
**Priority:** Medium  
**Labels:** backend-improvement, refactoring, DRY

### Problem
The content ViewSets in `backend/content/views.py` contain significant code duplication:

1. **Repetitive publish/unpublish methods:** NewsViewSet, EventViewSet, LibraryItemViewSet, and MemberViewSet all have identical publish/unpublish action methods
2. **Similar queryset filtering:** All ViewSets filter by `is_published` for unauthenticated users with nearly identical logic
3. **Repeated perform_create/perform_update:** All ViewSets set `created_by` and `last_modified_by` in the same way

### Proposed Solution
Create base classes and mixins to eliminate duplication:

1. **PublishableViewSetMixin** - provides publish/unpublish actions
2. **ContentFilterMixin** - handles common filtering logic
3. **AuthorTrackingMixin** - handles created_by/last_modified_by logic

### Benefits
- Reduces code duplication
- Easier to maintain publishing logic
- Consistent behavior across all content types
- Easier to add new content types

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create reusable mixins for common functionality
- [ ] Refactor all content ViewSets to use mixins
- [ ] Ensure all existing functionality is preserved
- [ ] Add tests for the new mixins
- [ ] Verify API endpoints continue to work correctly

## Issue 5: Remove development debugging code from production templates
**Priority:** High  
**Labels:** backend-improvement, security, templates

### Problem
Found debugging code left in production template `backend/templates/webpages/page_detail.html`:

**Lines 61-67:** Debug output that should be removed:
```html
<div>widgets: {{widgets}}</div>
<div>slots: {{slots}}</div>
<div>layout: {{layout}}</div>
<div>theme: {{theme}}</div>
<div>parent: {{parent}}</div>
<div>slug_parts: {{slug_parts}}</div>
<div>request: {{request}}</div>
```

**Lines 68-72:** Duplicate template logic that repeats lines 78-87

### Security & Performance Concerns
- Exposes internal application structure to end users
- May leak sensitive request information
- Adds unnecessary rendering overhead
- Clutters the HTML output

### Proposed Solution
- Remove debug output divs (lines 61-67)
- Remove duplicate template logic (lines 68-72)
- Ensure clean, production-ready template output

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Remove all debug output from template
- [ ] Remove duplicate template logic
- [ ] Verify template still renders correctly
- [ ] Test that all necessary data is still available to the template
- [ ] Check that no other templates have similar debug code

## Issue 6: Clean up empty and redundant compatibility layer files
**Priority:** Low  
**Labels:** backend-improvement, cleanup, documentation

### Problem
Found several files that are essentially empty or serve only as compatibility layers:

1. **`backend/core_widgets/models.py`** - Contains only imports and "Create your models here." comment
2. **Widget compatibility files** that could be simplified:
   - `backend/webpages/widgets.py` - 20-line compatibility wrapper
   - `backend/webpages/widget_models.py` - 17-line compatibility wrapper

### Issues
- Empty files add confusion about where models should be defined
- Compatibility layers add unnecessary indirection
- May confuse developers about the proper file structure

### Proposed Solution
1. **For empty models.py:** Either add actual models or include clear documentation about why it's empty
2. **For compatibility layers:** Simplify or remove if no longer needed, or add better documentation about their purpose
3. **Add clear documentation** about the widget app architecture and where new code should go

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Address empty core_widgets/models.py file
- [ ] Evaluate necessity of compatibility layer files
- [ ] Add clear documentation about widget architecture
- [ ] Ensure all existing imports continue to work
- [ ] Update developer documentation if architecture changes

## Issue 7: Simplify complex conditional logic in WebPage model and filters
**Priority:** Medium  
**Labels:** backend-improvement, refactoring, complexity

### Problem
Several areas have overly complex conditional logic that makes the code hard to understand and maintain:

### 1. WebPage.clean() Method (lines 531-614)
Complex validation logic with deeply nested conditions:
- Circular parent relationship validation
- Date validation logic
- Hostname validation with complex regex patterns
- Hostname conflict checking

### 2. WebPageFilter depth_level method (lines 94-107)
Hardcoded depth levels with nested filter conditions that don't scale beyond depth 2.

### 3. Complex inheritance chain logic
Methods like `get_layout_inheritance_info()` and `get_widgets_inheritance_info()` have complex nested loops and conditionals.

### Proposed Solution
1. **Extract validation methods:** Break WebPage.clean() into smaller, focused validation methods
2. **Create specialized validators:** Hostname validation, date validation, etc.
3. **Simplify filter logic:** Use more elegant solutions for depth filtering
4. **Refactor inheritance methods:** Break complex methods into smaller, single-purpose methods

### Benefits
- Easier to test individual validation rules
- More readable and maintainable code
- Better error messages for specific validation failures
- Easier to extend validation rules

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Extract WebPage.clean() into focused validation methods
- [ ] Simplify WebPageFilter depth_level logic
- [ ] Refactor complex inheritance methods
- [ ] Maintain all existing validation behavior
- [ ] Add unit tests for individual validation methods
- [ ] Improve error messages where possible

## Issue 8: Simplify over-engineered template validation system
**Priority:** Low  
**Labels:** backend-improvement, simplification, performance

### Problem
The template validation system in `backend/webpages/template_validator.py` appears to be over-engineered for the current use case:

### Areas of Concern:
1. **PerformanceAnalyzer class (lines 482-553):** Complex performance metrics calculation that may be unnecessary
2. **AccessibilityValidator:** Comprehensive a11y validation that might be overkill
3. **Multiple validation severity levels and types** that may not all be used
4. **Complex complexity scoring algorithm** that estimates render times

### Analysis Needed:
- Is all this validation actually being used?
- Are the performance metrics providing value?
- Is the complexity justified by the use cases?

### Proposed Solution
1. **Audit current usage:** Determine which validation features are actually used
2. **Simplify unused features:** Remove or simplify components that aren't providing value
3. **Keep core functionality:** Maintain essential security and structure validation
4. **Consider making optional:** Make advanced features opt-in rather than default

### Benefits
- Reduced complexity and maintenance burden
- Faster validation performance
- Easier to understand and modify
- Less code to test and maintain

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Audit which validation features are currently used
- [ ] Identify over-engineered components
- [ ] Simplify or remove unused complex features
- [ ] Maintain essential security validation
- [ ] Ensure performance doesn't degrade
- [ ] Update tests for simplified system

## Issue 9: Move rate limiting logic from views to middleware
**Priority:** Medium  
**Labels:** backend-improvement, architecture, middleware

### Problem
Found rate limiting code implemented directly in `CodeLayoutViewSet` in `backend/webpages/views.py` (lines 63-88):

```python
def _add_rate_limiting_headers(self, response, request, endpoint_type="default"):
    """Add rate limiting headers to prevent API abuse"""
    # Complex rate limiting logic using cache
```

### Issues with Current Approach:
- Rate limiting logic is mixed with business logic
- Would need to be duplicated across multiple ViewSets
- Harder to configure globally
- Couples views to rate limiting implementation

### Proposed Solution
Move rate limiting to Django middleware:

1. **Create RateLimitingMiddleware** that handles rate limiting globally
2. **Use decorators or settings** to configure rate limits per endpoint
3. **Remove rate limiting code from views** to keep them focused on business logic
4. **Centralize rate limiting configuration** in settings

### Benefits
- Separation of concerns
- Reusable across all views
- Centralized configuration
- Easier to test and modify rate limiting logic
- Views stay focused on their primary responsibility

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create RateLimitingMiddleware
- [ ] Move rate limiting logic out of CodeLayoutViewSet
- [ ] Configure rate limits through settings or decorators
- [ ] Maintain same rate limiting functionality
- [ ] Add tests for middleware
- [ ] Update documentation

## Issue 10: Audit and remove unused dependencies and imports
**Priority:** Low  
**Labels:** backend-improvement, cleanup, dependencies

### Problem
Need to conduct a comprehensive audit of unused dependencies and imports across the backend:

### Potential Issues Identified:
1. **Large requirements.txt:** Many dependencies that may not all be in use
2. **Try/except import blocks:** Multiple compatibility imports that may be outdated
3. **Debug-only dependencies:** Some packages might only be needed in development

### Dependencies to Review:
- `django-silk` (profiling) - may only be needed in development
- `django-prometheus` (monitoring) - verify if actually used
- `django-querycount` (development tool)
- `mcp>=1.0.0` (Model Context Protocol) - verify usage
- Various testing and code quality tools

### Import Patterns to Review:
- Multiple try/except blocks for core_widgets imports
- Imports that might be left over from refactoring
- Circular import workarounds that might no longer be needed

### Proposed Solution
1. **Dependency audit:** Use tools like `pip-autoremove` or `pipdeptree` to identify unused packages
2. **Import analysis:** Use tools to find unused imports
3. **Separate dev dependencies:** Move development-only packages to separate requirements file
4. **Clean up compatibility imports:** Simplify or remove outdated compatibility layers

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Audit all dependencies in requirements.txt
- [ ] Remove unused packages
- [ ] Separate development dependencies
- [ ] Clean up unused imports across codebase
- [ ] Simplify compatibility import blocks
- [ ] Update documentation about dependencies
- [ ] Ensure all tests still pass
