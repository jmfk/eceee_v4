## Command Workflow

### When to Use Each Command

| Scenario | Command to Use |
|----------|----------------|
| Changed Django settings | `sync-django-settings-to-production-repo.md` |

### Typical Development Workflow

1. **Make changes in eceee_v4** (development)
   - Add features, widgets, layouts
   - Update configurations
   - Test thoroughly

2. **Sync to eceee-components** (deployment)
   - Use appropriate sync command
   - Review changes
   - Commit to eceee-components

3. **Deploy to production**
   - Pull changes in production
   - Update .env file
   - Run migrations
   - Restart services

## Quick Start Examples

### Example 1: Full Sync After Major Development
```
You: "I've added AI tracking, updated widgets, and changed settings. Sync all to eceee-components."

Agent:
1. ‚úì Validates repositories
2. ‚úì Syncs Django settings (AI tracking config, etc.)
3. ‚úì Syncs Docker Compose (Celery services, env vars)
4. ‚úì Syncs widgets/layouts
5. ‚úì Generates comprehensive report
6. ‚ùì Asks for commit approval
```

### Example 2: Sync Just Settings
```
You: "Sync Django settings to production"

Agent:
1. ‚úì Compares settings files
2. ‚úì Identifies new configurations
3. ‚úì Applies changes to local_settings.py
4. ‚úì Verifies syntax
5. ‚úì Reports changes
6. ‚ùì Asks for commit approval
```

### Example 3: Sync New Widget
```
You: "Created new TableWidget. Sync it to eceee-components."

Agent:
1. ‚úì Verifies widget files exist
2. ‚úì Checks widget registry
3. ‚úì Syncs backend widget code
4. ‚úì Syncs widget template
5. ‚úì Syncs frontend editor
6. ‚úì Validates synced files
7. ‚ùì Asks for commit approval
```

## Command Features

All sync commands include:
- ‚úÖ **Pre-sync validation** - Checks files exist and syntax is valid
- ‚úÖ **Safe syncing** - Reviews changes before applying
- ‚úÖ **Post-sync verification** - Validates changes worked correctly
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive reporting** - Shows exactly what changed

```
Would you like me to commit these changes to eceee-components?
```

### Validation at Every Step
- Python syntax checking
- YAML syntax validation
- Widget/layout registry verification
- File integrity checks

### Detailed Change Reports
Every sync generates a report showing:
- Files modified/added/deleted
- Configuration changes
- New features added
- Security fixes applied

## Related Project Files

### Makefile Commands
The project includes built-in Makefile commands for common operations:

```bash
make sync-to    # Sync eceee_v4 ‚Üí eceee-components
make sync-from  # Sync eceee-components ‚Üí eceee_v4
```

### Sync Scripts
Direct shell scripts for syncing:

```bash
./sync-to-eceee-components.sh    # Manual sync TO eceee-components
./sync-from-eceee-components.sh  # Manual sync FROM eceee-components
```

---

## Tips for Using Commands

### 1. Be Specific
Instead of: "Sync stuff"  
Say: "Sync widgets to eceee-components"

### 2. Test First
Always test changes in development before syncing:
```bash
docker-compose up backend frontend
# Test features work correctly
# Then sync to production
```

### 3. Review Diffs
Before approving commits, review the changes:
```bash
cd /Users/jmfk/code/eceee-components
git diff
```

### 4. Use Full Sync Wisely
The master sync command is powerful but comprehensive. Use it when:
- Multiple systems were updated
- Major feature development complete
- Preparing for production deployment

Use individual commands when:
- Only settings changed
- Only widgets changed
- Quick fixes needed

## Troubleshooting

### Command Not Working?
1. Check file exists: `ls .cursor/commands/`
2. Verify you're in the right directory: `pwd`
3. Check repository exists: `ls /Users/jmfk/code/eceee-components`

### Sync Failed?
1. Read the error message carefully
2. Check file permissions
3. Ensure both repositories are accessible
4. Verify syntax of source files

### Changes Not Appearing?
1. Check you synced to the right directory
2. Verify files were actually modified in source
3. Review git status in eceee-components
4. Check for uncommitted changes

## Best Practices

1. **Test Before Sync** - Always test in development first
2. **One Feature at a Time** - Sync related changes together
3. **Review Changes** - Always review git diff before committing
4. **Descriptive Messages** - Use detailed commit messages
5. **Document Changes** - Update docs when adding features
6. **Coordinate** - Communicate with team about syncs
7. **Backup** - Consider branching in eceee-components first
