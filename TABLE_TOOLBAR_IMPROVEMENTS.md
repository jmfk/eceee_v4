# Table Toolbar Improvements

## Summary

Fixed multiple issues with the table toolbar and added new features based on user feedback.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… Removed Non-Functional "Text Cell" Button

**Problem**: The Text Cell button (Type icon) didn't do anything useful.

**Solution**: Removed the Content Type section entirely from the toolbar.

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/components/table-toolbar/TableToolbarButtons.jsx`
  - Removed Type import
  - Added Grid2X2 import (for new grid toggle button)
  - Removed entire "Content Type" section with Text Cell button

### 2. âœ… Fixed Bold and Italic Buttons

**Problem**: Bold and Italic buttons didn't work when clicking from toolbar.

**Root Cause**: The toolbar was calling `applyFormatting()` which only works on text selections within an editing cell, not on selected cells.

**Solution**: Changed to use `applyCellBold()` and `applyCellItalic()` methods which apply formatting to entire selected cells.

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/components/special-editors/TableEditorCore.js`
  - Updated handleToolbarCommand for 'bold' command to call `applyCellBold(selectedCells)`
  - Updated handleToolbarCommand for 'italic' command to call `applyCellItalic(selectedCells)`

**How It Works Now**:
1. User selects one or more cells
2. Clicks Bold or Italic button in toolbar
3. Entire content of selected cells gets wrapped in `<strong>` or `<em>` tags
4. Clicking again toggles the formatting off

### 3. âœ… Fixed Split Cell Button

**Problem**: Split cell button wasn't properly enabled/disabled.

**Root Cause**: The `canSplit` state was only checking if one cell was selected, not if that cell was actually merged.

**Solution**: Updated `getToolbarState()` to properly call `canSplit()` method which checks if the cell has colspan or rowspan > 1.

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/components/special-editors/TableEditorCore.js`
  - Updated getToolbarState() to call `this.canSplit(selectedCells[0])` instead of just checking count

**How It Works Now**:
- Split button is only enabled when:
  - Exactly one cell is selected, AND
  - That cell has colspan > 1 OR rowspan > 1

### 4. âœ… Added Grid Toggle Button

**Problem**: User wanted a way to show light cell borders for better visibility while editing.

**Solution**: Added a grid toggle button that shows/hides light gray borders on all cells.

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/components/table-toolbar/TableToolbarButtons.jsx`
  - Added new "View Options" section with Grid toggle button
  - Button shows active state (blue background) when grid is on
  - Positioned between Cell Operations and Text Formatting

- `frontend/src/components/special-editors/TableEditorCore.js`
  - Added `showGrid` property to constructor
  - Added `toggleGrid()` method that adds/removes 'show-grid' class
  - Added 'toggleGrid' case to handleToolbarCommand
  - Added `showGrid` to getToolbarState() return value

- `frontend/src/styles/table-editor.css`
  - Added `.table-editor-table.show-grid .table-editor-cell` rule
  - Sets light gray border (`#e5e7eb`) on all cells when grid is active

**How It Works**:
1. User clicks Grid button (Grid2X2 icon)
2. TableEditorCore toggles `showGrid` state
3. Adds/removes `show-grid` class to table element
4. CSS shows/hides light borders on all cells
5. Button shows blue background when active
6. State persists during editing session

### 5. âœ… Made Border and Color Pickers Toggle Properly

**Problem**: Border and color pickers should toggle open/closed when clicking the button.

**Solution**: Improved the click-outside-to-close logic to exclude the toggle buttons themselves.

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/components/table-toolbar/TableToolbarButtons.jsx`
  - Added `data-border-toggle` attribute to border button
  - Added `data-color-toggle` attribute to color button
  - Updated click-outside handler to check for these attributes
  - Added active state styling (blue background) when pickers are open
  - Clicking button toggles picker, clicking outside closes it

**How It Works Now**:
1. Click border/color button â†’ Picker opens, button shows blue background
2. Click button again â†’ Picker closes
3. Click outside picker â†’ Picker closes
4. Clicking inside picker â†’ Stays open
5. Only one picker can be open at a time

## New Toolbar Layout

From left to right:

1. **Structure** (6 buttons)
   - Import
   - Add Row
   - Remove Row
   - Add Column
   - Remove Column

2. **Cell Operations** (2 buttons)
   - Merge Cells (disabled unless 2+ cells selected)
   - Split Cell (disabled unless 1 merged cell selected)

3. **View Options** (1 button) ðŸ†•
   - Toggle Grid (shows light borders for visibility)

4. **Text Formatting** (2 buttons)
   - Bold (applies to selected cells) âœ… Fixed
   - Italic (applies to selected cells) âœ… Fixed

5. **Horizontal Alignment** (3 buttons)
   - Align Left
   - Align Center
   - Align Right

6. **Vertical Alignment** (3 buttons)
   - Align Top
   - Align Middle
   - Align Bottom

7. **Font Style** (1 dropdown)
   - Normal / Quote / Caption

8. **Styling** (2 buttons with popups)
   - Borders (toggle popup) âœ… Fixed
   - Colors (toggle popup) âœ… Fixed

## Visual Improvements

### Active State Indicators

- **Grid Toggle**: Blue background when grid is on
- **Border Picker**: Blue background when picker is open
- **Color Picker**: Blue background when picker is open

### Grid Visibility

When grid is on:
- All cells show light gray border (`1px solid #e5e7eb`)
- Helps visualize cell boundaries during editing
- Especially useful for:
  - Empty cells
  - Cells with minimal content
  - Merged cells
  - Planning table structure
