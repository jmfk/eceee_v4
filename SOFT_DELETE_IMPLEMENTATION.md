# Soft Delete & Restore System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive soft delete and restore system for pages with metadata storage, intelligent parent validation, and a user-friendly interface.

## Backend Changes

### 1. Database Schema
**File**: `backend/webpages/models/web_page.py`
- ✅ Added `deletion_metadata` JSONField to store restoration information
- ✅ Created migration `0045_add_deletion_metadata.py`
- ✅ Migration applied successfully

### 2. Model Enhancements
**File**: `backend/webpages/models/web_page.py`

**`_store_deletion_metadata(user)` method:**
- Stores comprehensive metadata including:
  - Parent ID and full parent ID chain
  - Page slug, title, sort_order
  - Children count
  - Deletion timestamp and user
  - Parent path display string

**Enhanced `soft_delete(user, recursive)` method:**
- Now calls `_store_deletion_metadata()` before marking as deleted
- Stores metadata for both the page and all descendants when recursive

**Enhanced `restore(user, recursive, child_ids)` method:**
- Returns detailed restoration result dictionary
- Validates parent existence
- Finds nearest existing ancestor if original parent deleted
- Handles slug uniqueness conflicts (auto-rename)
- Supports selective child restoration via `child_ids` parameter
- Returns warnings about relocated pages and renamed slugs

**New `_find_restoration_parent()` helper method:**
- Intelligent parent validation
- Walks up parent chain to find nearest existing ancestor
- Falls back to root page if no ancestors found

### 3. API Endpoints
**File**: `backend/webpages/views/webpage_views.py`

**New Endpoints:**

1. **GET `/api/v1/webpages/pages/deleted/`**  (Staff/Admin only)
   - Lists all soft-deleted pages
   - Supports search by title/slug
   - Supports ordering
   - Paginated response

2. **POST `/api/v1/webpages/pages/{id}/restore/`** (Staff/Admin only)
   - Restores single page
   - Request body: `{ recursive: bool, child_ids: [ids] }`
   - Returns restoration result with warnings

3. **POST `/api/v1/webpages/pages/bulk-restore/`** (Staff/Admin only)
   - Enhanced to use new restore signature
   - Returns detailed warnings for all restored pages

### 4. Serializer
**File**: `backend/webpages/serializers.py`

**New `DeletedPageSerializer`:**
- Fields: id, title, slug, deletedAt, deletedByUsername, deletionMetadata
- Computed fields:
  - `parentPath`: Formatted display of original location
  - `childrenCount`: Number of deleted children
  - `canRestore`: Boolean indicating if restoration is possible
  - `restorationWarnings`: Array of warning messages about:
    - Missing original parent
    - Alternative restoration location
    - Slug conflicts

## Frontend Changes

### 1. API Integration
**File**: `frontend/src/api/pages.js`

**New API Methods:**
- `getDeletedPages(params)`: Fetch paginated list of deleted pages
- `restorePage(pageId, options)`: Restore single page with options
- `bulkRestore(pageIds, recursive)`: Bulk restore multiple pages

**File**: `frontend/src/api/endpoints.js`
- Added `bulkRestore` endpoint definition

### 2. DeletedPagesView Component
**File**: `frontend/src/components/DeletedPagesView.jsx`

**Features:**
- Infinite scroll list of deleted pages
- Real-time search functionality
- Permission check (staff/admin only)
- Bulk selection with checkboxes
- Individual and bulk restore operations
- Warning indicators for problematic restorations
- Empty state with helpful messages
- Loading and error states

**Display Information:**
- Page title and slug
- Original location (parent path)
- Number of subpages
- Deletion date and user
- Restoration warnings (if any)

### 3. RestorePageDialog Component
**File**: `frontend/src/components/RestorePageDialog.jsx`

**Features:**
- Shows page details and original location
- Displays restoration warnings
- Lists deleted subpages with checkboxes
- "Select All" functionality for subpages
- Default: all subpages selected
- Restoration summary showing what will be restored
- Handles loading states for subpage fetching

### 4. TreePageManager Integration
**File**: `frontend/src/components/TreePageManager.jsx`

**Changes:**
- Added tab state management (`activeTab`: 'active' or 'deleted')
- Two tabs in header: "Active Pages" and "Deleted Pages"
- Conditional rendering:
  - Active tab: Shows page tree (existing functionality)
  - Deleted tab: Shows DeletedPagesView
- Hide bulk actions toolbar on deleted tab
- Hide search/filters/action buttons on deleted tab
- Clean tab switching UX

## Key Features

### Intelligent Restoration
1. **Parent Validation**: 
   - Checks if original parent still exists
   - If not, finds nearest existing ancestor in parent chain
   - Falls back to root page if no ancestors exist

2. **Slug Conflict Resolution**:
   - Automatically detects slug conflicts
   - Auto-renames with numeric suffix (e.g., 'about' → 'about-2')
   - Reports renamed slugs in warnings

3. **Selective Subpage Restoration**:
   - User can choose which subpages to restore
   - Default: all subpages selected
   - Checkbox list with "Select All" option

### User Experience
1. **Clear Warnings**:
   - Visual indicators for problematic restorations
   - Yellow warning badges with detailed messages
   - Warnings shown before and after restoration

2. **Permission Control**:
   - Only staff/admin users can view deleted pages
   - Permission checks on both frontend and backend
   - Clear "Access Denied" message for non-staff

3. **Search & Filter**:
   - Search deleted pages by title or slug
   - Infinite scroll for performance
   - Empty states with helpful messages

## Testing Recommendations

### Backend Tests (Not yet created)
Create: `backend/webpages/tests/test_soft_delete_restore.py`

Test cases:
- Soft delete stores correct metadata
- Restore to existing parent works
- Restore to missing parent finds nearest ancestor
- Restore handles slug conflicts (auto-rename)
- Selective subpage restoration works
- Permission checks work correctly

### Frontend Tests (Not yet created)
Create: `frontend/src/components/__tests__/DeletedPagesView.test.jsx`

Test cases:
- Deleted pages list renders correctly
- Search/filter works
- Restore dialog shows correct information
- Subpage checkboxes work
- Bulk restore works
- Permission checks work

## Usage Guide

### For Users:

1. **Viewing Deleted Pages**:
   - Navigate to Page Tree Manager
   - Click "Deleted Pages" tab
   - Search for specific pages if needed

2. **Restoring a Single Page**:
   - Click "Restore" button on any deleted page
   - Review restoration warnings (if any)
   - Select which subpages to restore
   - Click "Restore Page"

3. **Bulk Restore**:
   - Select multiple pages using checkboxes
   - Click "Restore Selected" button
   - Confirm the operation

### For Developers:

1. **Soft Delete a Page**:
```python
page.soft_delete(user=request.user, recursive=True)
```

2. **Restore a Page**:
```python
result = page.restore(
    user=request.user,
    recursive=True,  # or False
    child_ids=[1, 2, 3]  # optional, specific children to restore
)
# result contains: restored_count, warnings, relocated, slug_renamed, etc.
```

3. **Access Deletion Metadata**:
```python
metadata = page.deletion_metadata
# Contains: parent_id, parent_id_chain, parent_path_display, 
#           slug, title, sort_order, children_count, deleted_at, etc.
```

## Next Steps

1. **Write Tests**: Create comprehensive test suites for both backend and frontend

## Notes

- The system maintains full reversibility - nothing is permanently deleted
- All deletion metadata is stored in JSON for flexibility
- The parent chain ensures we can always find the best restoration location
- Slug conflicts are handled automatically to prevent validation errors
- Permission system ensures only authorized users can manage deleted pages
