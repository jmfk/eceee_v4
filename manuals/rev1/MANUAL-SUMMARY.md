## Browser MCP Tools Note

The original plan included automated screenshot capture using browser MCP tools. These tools were not available during documentation creation, so:

1. All documentation has been completed with screenshot placeholders
2. A comprehensive screenshot reference guide has been created
3. Screenshots can be captured manually or automatically when browser tools become available
4. Image references use relative paths that will work once screenshots are added
