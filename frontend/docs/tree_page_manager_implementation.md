- **Improved Feedback**: Better visual indication of interactive elements

### Icon Tooltips (Latest Addition)

**📁 Page/Folder Icons:**
- **📄 Individual Pages**: "Page"
- **📁 Folders**: "Folder (X)" - shows child count

**🚦 Publication Status Icons:**
- **🌐 Published** (Green Globe): "Published"
- **⏰ Scheduled** (Blue Clock): "Scheduled"  
- **📝 Unpublished** (Gray Alert): "Unpublished"
- **📝 Draft** (Gray Alert): "Draft"

- **Other**: "Create page", "Clear clipboard", "Paste at top", "Paste at bottom"

**All icons now have `cursor-help` styling to indicate they're interactive and provide information on hover.**

### Tooltip Text Optimization

**Succinct Messaging:**
- **Before**: "Edit 'Home Page' - Open page editor" (verbose, repetitive)
- **After**: "Edit" (clear, concise, to the point)
- **Benefit**: Faster reading, reduced visual clutter, immediate understanding

**Smart Context Retention:**
- **Expand buttons**: Show child count when relevant: "Expand (3)"
- **Folder icons**: Display count efficiently: "Folder (5)"
- **Children count**: Simplified: "3 children"
- **Status icons**: Direct status: "Published", "Draft", etc.

### Tooltip Positioning Enhancement

**Improved Vertical Spacing:**
- **Previous**: `mb-2` (8px spacing) - tooltips appeared close to elements
- **Current**: `mb-4` (16px spacing) - tooltips positioned higher up for better visibility
- **Benefit**: Reduces visual clutter and prevents tooltips from overlapping with nearby elements

### Animated Dropzones Feature

**Dynamic Visual Feedback:**
- **Before Dropzone**: Blue line indicator above hovered element
- **After Dropzone**: Blue line indicator below hovered element  
- **Inside Dropzone**: Dashed border around folder with "Drop inside" label
- **Smart Positioning**: Dropzones respect indentation levels for proper hierarchy

**Enhanced Visual Feedback:**
- **Consistent Heights**: All dropzones now have uniform 10px height for easy targeting
- **Smart Color States**: Grey (border-gray-300) when not hovered, blue (border-blue-500) when actively hovered
- **Text Labels**: Clear "Drop before/inside/after [Page Name]" labels instead of dots
- **Smooth Transitions**: 200ms color transitions for professional feel

**Correct Dropzone Positioning:**
- **Before Dropzone**: Appears above the page element with "Drop before [Page]" label
- **Inside Dropzone**: Appears after the page but before children, indented with "Drop inside [Page]" label  
- **After Dropzone**: Appears after the page and all its children with "Drop after [Page]" label
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Inside dropzones use level+1 indentation to show nesting relationship

**Interactive Hover System:**
- **Individual Hover States**: Each dropzone tracks its own hover state independently
- **Visual Feedback**: Only the hovered dropzone shows blue colors and blue text
- **Mouse Event Handling**: Clean onMouseEnter/onMouseLeave for reliable hover detection
- **Targeted Visibility**: Dropzones appear when page is hovered or specific dropzone is hovered
- **Smart Visibility**: `isHovered || hoveredDropzone === position` for focused interaction

**Interaction Design:**
- **Hover Activation**: Dropzones appear only when dragging over valid targets
- **Position Indicators**: Small circular dots show exact drop positions
- **Contextual Labels**: "Drop inside [Page Name]" for folder dropzones
- **Pointer Events**: Dropzones accept drops and prevent event bubbling

**Technical Implementation:**
- **DropZone Component**: Reusable component with position prop ('before', 'after', 'inside')
- **State Management**: Global drag state tracked in TreePageManager
- **Event Handling**: Enhanced drag handlers with dropzone-specific drop logic
- **Performance**: Conditional rendering - dropzones only exist when needed

### Hostname Validation & Warnings

**Visual Warning System:**
- **Alert Triangle Icon**: Amber warning icon for top-level pages without hostnames
- **Tooltip Explanation**: "Missing hostname - This top-level page needs at least one hostname"
- **Smart Detection**: Only shows for pages at level 0 (top-level) without hostnames
- **Non-blocking**: Pages can still be moved, but user is warned

**Move Validation:**
- **Real-time Warnings**: Toast notifications when moving pages without hostnames to top level
- **Position-aware Logic**: Detects when moves result in top-level positioning
- **Informative Messages**: Clear feedback like '"Page Name" moved to top level but has no hostnames'

**Enhanced Drop Logic:**
- **Position-based Parent Assignment**: 
  - `'child'/'inside'` → target becomes parent
  - `'before'/'after'` → target's parent becomes parent (sibling positioning)
- **Smart Hierarchy Handling**: Correctly calculates parent relationships for all drop positions
- **API Integration**: Proper parent ID passed to backend based on position logic

## Next Steps

1. **Implement copy/duplicate functionality** - Backend API support needed for page duplication
2. **Add expand all feature** with recursive loading
3. **Add bulk selection and operations** - Multi-select with checkboxes
4. **Enhance visual feedback** for drag & drop (drop zones, ghost images)
5. **Add keyboard navigation support** - Arrow keys, Enter, Delete shortcuts
6. **Consider adding right-click context menus** - Alternative to hover buttons
7. **Add undo/redo functionality** - Action history with rollback capability

## Technical Implementation

### Optimistic Updates

The TreePageManager implements optimistic updates for all operations to provide a smooth, responsive user experience:

**How it works:**
1. **Immediate UI Update**: When a user performs an action (drag/drop, cut/paste, delete), the UI updates immediately
2. **Store Previous State**: Before making changes, the current state is stored for potential rollback
3. **API Call**: The actual API request is made in the background
4. **Error Handling**: If the API call fails, the UI automatically reverts to the previous state

**Benefits:**
- **No flickering or reloading** when moving pages
- **Instant feedback** for user actions
- **Automatic error recovery** with state rollback
- **Better perceived performance** even on slow networks

**Implementation Details:**
- Uses helper functions `updatePageInTree`, `removePageFromTree`, and `addPageToTree`
- **Smart sort order calculation**:
  - `calculateSortOrderAbove()` - Calculates position above target page
  - `calculateSortOrderBelow()` - Calculates position below target page
  - Handles edge cases (first/last positions) automatically
- **Multiple paste modes** supported: `child`, `above`, `below`, `top`, `bottom`
- Mutations store `previousPages` in context for rollback
- Local state updates happen before API calls
- Error handlers revert to stored previous state

## Dependencies

- React 19
- @tanstack/react-query for data fetching
- lucide-react for icons
- react-hot-toast for notifications
- Tailwind CSS for styling

## Testing Coverage

**✅ Test Results:**
- **DropZone Component**: 4/4 tests passing - Validates positioning styles and visibility logic
- **Hostname Validation**: 4/4 tests passing - Tests warning logic for pages without hostnames  
- **TreePageManager**: 9/10 tests passing - One minor timing issue with refresh button (known issue)
- **Build Success**: All components compile without errors
- **Toast Fix**: Fixed `toast.warning is not a function` error by using `toast()` with warning icon
- **Drag and Drop Fix**: Resolved issue where dropzones stopped working by adjusting visibility logic

**Sample Data for Testing:**
- **23 Total Pages**: Multi-level hierarchy with 4 levels deep in some branches
- **Top-level Pages**: Home (with hostnames), Blog (with hostnames), Staging Site (no hostnames), Development (no hostnames)
- **2 Hostname Warnings**: "Staging Site" and "Development" pages show warning icons
- **Complex Hierarchy**: Services → Consulting → Strategy/Technical Consulting (3 levels)
- **Varied Layouts**: Uses single_column, two_column, three_column, landing_page, and minimal layouts
- **Easy Recreation**: Run `docker-compose exec backend python manage.py create_sample_pages --clear`

## Summary

The TreePageManager now provides a **professional-grade drag and drop experience** with:
- **Clear text labels** for all dropzones showing exactly where pages will be placed
- **Smart hover system** with grey/blue color states for precise visual feedback
- **Correct dropzone positioning** with proper before/inside/after placement and indentation
- **Disabled interactions during drag** to prevent accidental expand/collapse operations

1. **Fixed dropzone order**: Before → Page → Inside (indented) → Children → After
2. **Enhanced visual hierarchy**: Inside dropzones use level+1 indentation to show nesting
3. **Text labels for all dropzones**: Clear "Drop before/inside/after [Page Name]" labels
4. **Smart hover system**: Grey when not hovered, blue when actively hovered during drag
5. **Fixed hover detection**: Clean mouse event handling for reliable hover feedback
6. **Fixed drag and drop**: Restored functionality with targeted dropzone visibility
7. **Disabled expand/collapse during drag**: Prevents accidental tree changes during moves
8. **Animation framework**: CSS transitions ready for smooth page movement animations
9. **Hostname warnings**: Immediate visual feedback for configuration issues
10. **Sample page hierarchy**: Rich test data with varied layouts and warning scenarios
